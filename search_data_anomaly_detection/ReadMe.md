# Search Queries Anomaly Detection
Search Queries Anomaly Detection involves identifying queries that deviate significantly from expected performance metrics. This process is crucial for businesses as it helps uncover potential problems or opportunities, such as unusually high or low click-through rates (CTRs). In this project, I will guide you through implementing Search Queries Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning techniques in Python.

## Process:
1. Collect historical search query data from the chosen source, such as a search engine or a websiteâ€™s search function.
2. Perform an initial analysis to assess the distribution of search queries, their frequency, and any discernible patterns or trends.
3. Extract relevant features or attributes from the search query dataset to facilitate anomaly detection.
4. Select an appropriate anomaly detection method. Options include statistical techniques like Z-score analysis and machine learning algorithms such as Isolation Forests or One-Class SVM.
5. Train the chosen model using the preprocessed data.
6. Apply the trained model to the search query dataset to pinpoint anomalies or outliers.
