# Credit Score Classification using Machine Learning
Financial institutions like banks and credit card companies assess your credit score to evaluate your financial reliability. This evaluation enables them to promptly approve loans for customers deemed creditworthy. Nowadays, these institutions employ Machine Learning algorithms to categorize all customers in their database based on their credit histories. In this project, I'll guide you through the process of credit score classification using Machine Learning in Python.

## Process:

Here's an alternative version:

Banks and credit card companies categorize their customers into three credit score levels:

1. Good
2. Standard
3. Poor

Individuals with a good credit score can secure loans from various banks and financial institutions. To perform Credit Score Classification, we require a labeled dataset containing credit scores.
